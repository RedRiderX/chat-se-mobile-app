# This project is no longer maintained!

The original aspirations of this project have been made manifest in [Chatsey](https://github.com/fredley/chatsey).

Because of this I've stopped development on this version of a Chat.SE mobile app.

Be sure to check out Chatsey for all your mobile Chat.SE needs!

Currently being built with PhoneGap Build, and binaries can be found there: https://build.phonegap.com/apps/871794/

Thanks to Medium Deviation for their [userstyle](http://userstyles.org/styles/97811/stack-exchange-chat-mobile) which I used as a jumping off point for these customizations.

Thanks to [Tom Medley](http://tommedley.com) for their [Soda Dark inspired userstyle](http://userstyles.org/styles/97667/soda-chat)

## Contribute
If you'd like to contribute, please limit it to `www/css/chat.window.scss` and the `www/css/scss/` folder for now.

If you have suggestions for improving the structure of the app wrapper itself, please make an issue or hit me up in SE Chat.
